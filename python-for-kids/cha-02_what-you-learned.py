# Chapter 2 - Calculations and Variables

# In this chapter you learned how to do simple equations
# using Python operators and how to use parentheses to 
# control the order of operations (the order in which 
# Python evaluates the parts of the equations). We then 
# created variables to label values and used those 
# variables in our calculations.

# Note the above chapter name and intro are from the 
# book, and the examples listed below are a combination
# from the book and some created by myself, Mark Blais.

# What I Learned...


# These are operators.
#  + is addition
#  - is subtration
#  * is multiplication
#  / is division

# These are variables.
found_coins = 20
magic_coins = 10
stolen_coins = 3

# The equation stored into a variable.
answer = found_coins + magic_coins * 365 - stolen_coins * 52

# The function (new in Python 3: print is now a function).
print(answer)
