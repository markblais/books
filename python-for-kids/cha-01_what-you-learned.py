# Chapter 1 - Not All Snakes Slither

# We began simply in this chapter with a Hello World
# application- the program nearly everyone starts with 
# when they learn computer programming. In the next 
# chapter, we'll do some more useful things with the 
# Python shell.

# Note the above chapter name and intro are from the #
# book, and the examples listed below are a combination
# from the book and some created by myself, Mark Blais.

# What I Learned...


# Prints Hello World on the screen.
# Also the very first program used to test the
# installation of the Python library.
print('Hello World')
